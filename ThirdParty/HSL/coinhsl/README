Installation
============

You may compile IPOPT either before or after the installation of this package.
While doing so ensure that the IPOPT directory ThirdParty/HSL does not contain
any HSL code.

Compilation follows the standard process:
   ./configure
   make

To install the library, module and header files into /usr/local you may
use the following command (this may require root permissions):
   make install

To use the library, ensure that the library libcoinhsl.so can be found
by both the linker and the dynamic library loader. You can either add the
path to the ldconfig configuration, or explicitly set the environment
variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

For further options, including installation in locations other than
/usr/local and specifying the use of particular Fortran compilers and
compile flags please run
   ./configure --help

The file INSTALL contains more detailed information.
